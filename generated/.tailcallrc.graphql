The @http operator indicates that a field or node is backed by a REST API.For instance, 
if you add the @http operator to the `users` field of the Query type with a path 
argument of `"/users"`, it signifies that the `users` field is backed by a REST API. 
The path argument specifies the path of the REST API. In this scenario, the GraphQL 
server will make a GET request to the API endpoint specified when the `users` field 
is queried.
