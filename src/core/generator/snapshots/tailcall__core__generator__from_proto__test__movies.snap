  A Duration represents a signed, fixed-length span of time represented
  as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at nanosecond
  resolution. It is independent of any calendar and concepts like "day"
  or "month". It is related to Timestamp in that the difference between
  two Timestamp values is a Duration and it can be added or subtracted
  from a Timestamp. Range is approximately +-10,000 years.
  # Examples
  Example 1: Compute Duration from two Timestamps in pseudo code.
  Timestamp start = ...;
  Timestamp end = ...;
  Duration duration = ...;
  duration.seconds = end.seconds - start.seconds;
  duration.nanos = end.nanos - start.nanos;
  if (duration.seconds < 0 && duration.nanos > 0) {
  duration.seconds += 1;
  duration.nanos -= 1000000000;
  } else if (duration.seconds > 0 && duration.nanos < 0) {
  duration.seconds -= 1;
  duration.nanos += 1000000000;
  }
  Example 2: Compute Timestamp from Timestamp + Duration in pseudo code.
  Timestamp start = ...;
  Duration duration = ...;
  Timestamp end = ...;
  end.seconds = start.seconds + duration.seconds;
  end.nanos = start.nanos + duration.nanos;
  if (end.nanos < 0) {
  end.seconds -= 1;
  end.nanos += 1000000000;
  } else if (end.nanos >= 1000000000) {
  end.seconds += 1;
  end.nanos -= 1000000000;
  }
  Example 3: Compute Duration from datetime.timedelta in Python.
  td = datetime.timedelta(days=3, minutes=10)
  duration = Duration()
  duration.FromTimedelta(td)
  # JSON Mapping
  In JSON format, the Duration type is encoded as a string rather than an
  object, where the string ends in the suffix "s" (indicating seconds) and
  is preceded by the number of seconds, with nanoseconds expressed as
  fractional seconds. For example, 3 seconds with 0 nanoseconds should be
  encoded in JSON format as "3s", while 3 seconds and 1 nanosecond should
  be expressed in JSON format as "3.000000001s", and 3 seconds and 1
  microsecond should be expressed in JSON format as "3.000001s".

  A Timestamp represents a point in time independent of any time zone or local
  calendar, encoded as a count of seconds and fractions of seconds at
  nanosecond resolution. The count is relative to an epoch at UTC midnight on
  January 1, 1970, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar which extends the
  Gregorian calendar backwards to year one.
  All minutes are 60 seconds long. Leap seconds are "smeared" so that no leap
  second table is needed for interpretation, using a [24-hour linear
  smear](https://developers.google.com/time/smear).
  The range is from 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z to 9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z. By
  restricting to that range, we ensure that we can convert to and from [RFC
  3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date strings.
  # Examples
  Example 1: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `time()`.
  Timestamp timestamp;
  timestamp.set_seconds(time(NULL));
  timestamp.set_nanos(0);
  Example 2: Compute Timestamp from POSIX `gettimeofday()`.
  struct timeval tv;
  gettimeofday(&tv, NULL);
  Timestamp timestamp;
  timestamp.set_seconds(tv.tv_sec);
  timestamp.set_nanos(tv.tv_usec * 1000);
  Example 3: Compute Timestamp from Win32 `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()`.
  FILETIME ft;
  GetSystemTimeAsFileTime(&ft);
  UINT64 ticks = (((UINT64)ft.dwHighDateTime) << 32) | ft.dwLowDateTime;
  // A Windows tick is 100 nanoseconds. Windows epoch 1601-01-01T00:00:00Z
  // is 11644473600 seconds before Unix epoch 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
  Timestamp timestamp;
  timestamp.set_seconds((INT64) ((ticks / 10000000) - 11644473600LL));
  timestamp.set_nanos((INT32) ((ticks % 10000000) * 100));
  Example 4: Compute Timestamp from Java `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
  long millis = System.currentTimeMillis();
  Timestamp timestamp = Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(millis / 1000)
  .setNanos((int) ((millis % 1000) * 1000000)).build();
  Example 5: Compute Timestamp from Java `Instant.now()`.
  Instant now = Instant.now();
  Timestamp timestamp =
  Timestamp.newBuilder().setSeconds(now.getEpochSecond())
  .setNanos(now.getNano()).build();
  Example 6: Compute Timestamp from current time in Python.
  timestamp = Timestamp()
  timestamp.GetCurrentTime()
  # JSON Mapping
  In JSON format, the Timestamp type is encoded as a string in the
  [RFC 3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format. That is, the
  format is "{year}-{month}-{day}T{hour}:{min}:{sec}[.{frac_sec}]Z"
  where {year} is always expressed using four digits while {month}, {day},
  {hour}, {min}, and {sec} are zero-padded to two digits each. The fractional
  seconds, which can go up to 9 digits (i.e. up to 1 nanosecond resolution),
  are optional. The "Z" suffix indicates the timezone ("UTC"); the timezone
  is required. A proto3 JSON serializer should always use UTC (as indicated by
  "Z") when printing the Timestamp type and a proto3 JSON parser should be
  able to accept both UTC and other timezones (as indicated by an offset).
  For example, "2017-01-15T01:30:15.01Z" encodes 15.01 seconds past
  01:30 UTC on January 15, 2017.
  In JavaScript, one can convert a Date object to this format using the
  standard
  [toISOString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString)
  method. In Python, a standard `datetime.datetime` object can be converted
  to this format using
  [`strftime`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime) with
  the time format spec '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ'. Likewise, in Java, one can use
  the Joda Time's [`ISODateTimeFormat.dateTime()`](
  http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#dateTime%2D%2D
  ) to obtain a formatter capable of generating timestamps in this format.
