# Starting in Rust 1.62 you can use `cargo add` to add dependencies 
# to your project.
#
# If you're using an older Rust version,
# download cargo-edit(https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit#installation) 
# to install the `add` subcommand.
#
# Running `cargo add DEPENDENCY_NAME` will
# add the latest version of a dependency to the list,
# and it will keep the alphabetic ordering for you.
