import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs"
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem"

Now, run the following command to start the server with the full path to the file that you created earlier.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="graphql" label="graphql">

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.graphql
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yml" label="yml">

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.yml
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json" label="json">

```bash
tailcall start ./jsonplaceholder.json
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the command succeeds, you should see logs like the following below.

```bash
 🚀 Tailcall launched at [0.0.0.0:8000]
 🌍 Playground: http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

The server starts with the schema provided and prints out a load of meta information. We will cover those in detail in a bit. For now, open the **playground URL** in a new tab in your browser and try it out for yourself!
