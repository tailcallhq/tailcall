This command fetches and executes the Tailcall installation script. The installed files are located in the `~/.tailcall` directory.

Upon completion of the installation, extend your `PATH` environment variable to include the `~/.tailcall/bin` directory:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.tailcall/bin
```

## Docker

If you want to install Tailcall with Docker, follow the steps below. Before starting, ensure Docker is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

1. Pull the latest Tailcall Docker image using the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     docker pull tailcall.docker.scarf.sh/tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     <Version />
   </CodeBlock>

   This command fetches the latest version of the Tailcall Docker image from the Docker registry.

2. Run the Tailcall Docker container with the following command:

   <CodeBlock language="bash">
     docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 tailcall.docker.scarf.sh/tailcallhq/tailcall/tc-server:
     <Version />
   </CodeBlock>

   This command starts the Tailcall server in a Docker container. Similar to the homebrew installation, it exposes a the graphQL endpoint on port 8080.
